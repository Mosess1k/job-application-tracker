# Job Application Tracker

This is a full-stack web app I built to track job applications. You can log in, add jobs you’ve applied for, update their status, and see everything in one clean dashboard. The app uses **React** for the frontend, **Node.js/Express** for the backend, and **PostgreSQL** for storing the data.

## Features

- **Login/Authentication** – Users can log in securely with JWT.  
- **Dashboard** – See all your job applications in cards with title, company, status, and date applied.  
- **Add/Update Jobs** – Add new jobs, change the status (Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected), and delete jobs you no longer need.  
- **REST API** – Backend handles all the job CRUD operations.  
- **Dark Theme** – Minimal, professional look that’s easy on the eyes.
